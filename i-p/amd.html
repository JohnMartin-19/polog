    <h1>The new competitor of Intel</h1>
    <div class="column">
        <p>The Ryzen has a series of processor ,just like the Intel
            <ul>Here are some if its series,
                <li>Amd 3</li>
                <li>Amd 5</li>
                <li>Amd 7</li>
                <li>Amd 9</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>We will take a look at <span class="vital">Amd Ryzen 3</span></h2>
    <div class="column">
        <p>The Ryzen 3 is one of the few AMD Ryzen chips that comes with built-in graphics processing, which means that if you are using it in a new budget pc build, you dont need to spend an extra amount of cash on a dedicated graphic card.Most intergrated
            graphic processors offer basic functionality, such as the ability to display videos and run apps, but they cant handle demanding tasks like powering multiple 4K monitors or running 3D-graphics-intensive games. The Ryzen 3 IGP, silicon on the
            die dubbed "Radeon RX Vega 8," is more powerful than youll see in a budget processor.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Sizing up the Intel Competition</h3>
    <p>Intel offers many desktop-CPU alternatives to the Ryzen 3, but all of them use IGPs that are less powerful than the Radeon RX Vega 8.This puts the Intel chips at a disadvantage for people looking to build a budget gaming PC without a discrete graphic
        card.
    </p>
    <p>In general, the test results confirm the the Ryzen 3 is incrementally better than its predecessors, significantly ahead of the Intel Pentium and the Celeron offerings, and noticeably behind the performance of the Ryzen 5.
